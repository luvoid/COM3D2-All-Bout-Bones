## CM3D2 Converter Issues

### CM3D2 Converter did not install correctly
* Make sure you are using Blender 2.79 (if it MUST be 2.8+, you can find a modified version but 2.79 is recomended).
* Make sure everything was put in the add-ins folder correctly at `"C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.79\scripts\addons\CM3D2 Converter"`
* If it is just a folder and `_init_.py` inside, try copying the files into the folder manually.
